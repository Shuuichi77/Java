# Project - Baba is You
This project was made during my 1st semester of my 3rd year of Computer Science Degree.
You can read the user.pdf in docs for the rules.

Note that this project wasn't finished in time because I simply didn't have enough time (I did it alone contrary to all of my classmates because odd number of people). 
The game does work all according to what I planned, however it should have had commands to launch the game and levels, but it unfortunately doesn't have any commands

There won't be any changes in the future.
